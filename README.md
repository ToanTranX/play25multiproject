# Modular Play Webapp Using Multiple Projects

Heavily modified and updated from the [Kifi blog post](http://eng.42go.com/multi-project-deployment-in-play-framework), which is dated and needs to be read with discretion.
This version corrects errors in the original project and adds globally available reverse routes and a non-Play intermediate subproject.
