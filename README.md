# Modular Play Webapp Using Multiple Projects

Taken from the [Kifi blog post](http://eng.42go.com/multi-project-deployment-in-play-framework), which is dated and needs to be read with discretion.
This verison corrects errors in the original project.
Switched the unit tests from Specs2 to ScalaTest; more of them run, but problems remain.
Pull requests are invited.
